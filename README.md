📊 Financial Behaviors and Preferences Analysis 💰
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of financial behaviors and preferences using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas. 📈 The dataset helps in visualizing investment trends based on gender, investment avenues, stock market preferences, age groups, investment tenures, and expected returns. 🎯

📋 Project Overview 🧐
🔥 Steps Followed:
Import Libraries 🛠️: Essential libraries for data handling and visualization, including Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy.
Load Dataset 📂: The dataset is assumed to be preloaded in the script and is utilized for various visualizations.
Understand Data 📊:
Displayed the first few rows and summarized the data to understand the structure. 🔍
Reviewed the data types and basic statistics for each column.
Data Preprocessing 🧹:
The dataset was assumed to be cleaned and preprocessed before visualizations were created (e.g., handling missing values). 🧑‍💻
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍:
The visualizations offer insights into financial behaviors and preferences based on gender, stock market inclinations, and more.
Data Visualization 📊:
Created various visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore the data in-depth.
🧑‍💼 Dataset Description 📚
The dataset contains information regarding financial behaviors and includes the following columns:

Gender 👩‍🦰👨‍🦱: The gender of the investor.
Stock_Market 📈: The stock market preference (e.g., stocks, mutual funds).
